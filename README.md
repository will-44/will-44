## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD. Student at ETS in Montreal. I'm interested in mobile manipulator robots and their applications. Currently I'm working to optimize the robot reachability map by moving its mobile base. Including AI, robot control, opencv vision.

### My Projects
- [curobo_ros](https://github.com/Lab-CORO/curobo_ros): My current project for a light implementation of Curobo
- [cleaning](https://github.com/Lab-CORO/cleaning): The first iteration of my cleaning algorithm to write an article
- [CapacityNet](https://github.com/Lab-CORO/CapaciNet): The data generation for a futur CNN to generate capacity map in real-time
- [HoloSoft](https://github.com/will-44/holosoft.git): A software for the control of an omnidirectional robot with a stm32 

### Experience
These are some technologies I use:
